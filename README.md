# AP-CSA

I took the AP-CSA test on May 4th, 2022 and got a 5 :) In order to prepare I have been studying the [barron's book](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Premium-2022-2023-Comprehensive/dp/1506264158) and writing a lot of FRQ code.

On April 21st and April 25th, 2022 I took the official CSA practice FRQ in my school. I scored a 39/40 on the MCQ and a 35/36 on the FRQ resulting 77.89/80 on the over all test.

## Organization

The [Practice Code](https://github.com/asubramanian08/AP-CSA/tree/master/PracticeCode) folder has all the code I created to practice for the exam.

All the other code is for a Yahtzee project I did for school. Note that [Yahtzee.java](Yahtzee.java) is the "main" file for the Yahtzee project.
