### AP-CSA

I took the AP-CSA test on May 4th, 2022 and got a 5 :) In order to prepare I have been studying the [barron's book](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Science-Premium-2022-2023-Comprehensive/dp/1506264158) and writing a lot of FRQ code. This repository contains all the code I created to study the AP CSA. On April 21st and April 25th, 2022 I took the official CSA practice FRQ in my school. I scored a 39/40 on the MCQ and a 35/36 on the FRQ resulting 77.89/80 on the over all test.
