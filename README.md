### AP-CS-Prep

I am taking the AP-CSA test on May 4th, 2022. In order to prepare have has been studying the barron's book and writing a lot of FRQ code. This repository contains all the code I created to study the AP CSA.

### Organization

The class I am studying from has sections of related FRQs. The classes I make in these folders are all under a common topic and often depend on each-other. Since the class doesn't break down the units like the AP-CSA standard, each folder has a number referring to which unit it is from.
